### 1st Commit

- Added a short Qualcomm (QCOM) summary to the README (ticker, HQ, core business and markets).
- Added a small Flask API script at `app/data.py` that loads `qcom.us.txt` into a pandas DataFrame and serves it as an HTML table (`/`), a full view (`/full`) and a JSON endpoint (`/api`).
- Included usage notes and a quick syntax check; dependencies: `flask`, `pandas`.
